If you're having a hard time coming up with ideas to "propose" for your team's Twitter Bot, consider using (or modifying) one of these:

- Let Me Google That: Users send the bot a query, bot returns Google's Custom Search API result (within free query limits)

- Rhyme Bot: Bot tries to create a rhyme based on your username
- Key Phrase Responder: Periodically watches the Twitter stream for a specific phrase (e.g. famous line from a book or movie, or quotes from a certain author), and Retweets when it sees it.
